TODO post json.jbuilder. do we need user_id in posts?
TODO json.builder. need to implement likes + comments for posts
TODO json.jbuilder. need to implement followers + following for users
TODO tested ApiUtil#create. After it gets called, the dispatch needs to call PostStore#addPost
      which will add the created post to _post and set the post.user = {username: current_user}.

THINGS TO REMEMBER
-setup models
-setup associations
-setup routes


NOTES
-had trouble with Sign out Button. It would throw an error but on refresh it would sign you out.
  -the problem was that my ajax request was expecting some sort of json response.
  -i fixed this by going into my session controller and setting it to render json and a 200 response.
    -instead of letting session controller redirect,
      now my ajax success callback would call window.location = "session/new";
