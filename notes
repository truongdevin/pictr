NOTES
-had trouble with Sign out Button. It would throw an error but on refresh it would sign you out.
  -the problem was that my ajax request was expecting some sort of json response.
  -i fixed this by going into my session controller and setting it to render json and a 200 response.
    -instead of letting session controller redirect,
      now my ajax success callback would call window.location = "session/new";

-i had trouble getting my frontend application to get the current user who was signed in.
- i resolved this by making a new api::user_controller that has an index method.
  - the index method calls the current_user method i defined in application_controller and outputs it in json
  - once the user signs in, the app component mounts which has a "componentdidmount" method that calls
    client action which calls api_utils#fetchCurrentUser which accesses the database to grab the current user
    and set them inside a localStorage("currentUser", JSON.stringify(user)).
    - to access the user. do JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("currentUser")).id
